        <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Currently CTO for a tech company which is focused on distributed data storage, and blockchain application development. 
                <br>Originally the company started out mining cryptocurrency, but since shortly before the crypto bubble pop we 
                <br>began transitioning our infrastructure to a data center that focuses on distributed networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had a pretty diverse work history primarily consisting of Linux Systems Administration, backend service development, smart contract development, and running a large scale mining farm.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not particularily good with frontend development (as this website quite clearly shows), and spend most of my time plugged into technology working or learning.
